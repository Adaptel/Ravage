### TODO

Items listed here should be changed one at a time, and the line removed and this
file and the changed files committed together. After a session of N changes the
PDF should be updated and pushed. The PDF should not be updated with each and
every change as there is no benefit and a binary repository size drawback.

Done - Components and connections on CPU page: http://forum.diyefi.org/viewtopic.php?p=17767#p17767
 - Annotations of CPU sheet components from: http://forum.diyefi.org/viewtopic.php?p=17767#p17767
Done - Analogue capacitor values from: http://forum.diyefi.org/viewtopic.php?p=17706#p17706
Done - Wakeup circuit supply voltage source from: http://forum.diyefi.org/viewtopic.php?p=17706#p17706
 - Ignitor output LED connection from: http://forum.diyefi.org/viewtopic.php?p=17706#p17706
 - Injector drive pull down resistors from: http://forum.diyefi.org/viewtopic.php?p=17706#p17706
 - Add (5.6V) zener protection of 5V rails from: http://forum.diyefi.org/viewtopic.php?p=17706#p17706

All pages that are changed must be rechecked and enter another cycle of fix and
then check or be confirmed good and then locked down.

### Still To Review

These pages have not been checked and confirmed good or had fixes suggested.

 - RS232 for LC-1 page
 - Power supply page

Once checked they should be moved to the TODO or to Lock Down.

### Still To Add/Do

Known issues which don't have a solution 100% nailed down yet.

 - Add knock sensor interface page
 - Switch to new connector type
 - Finalise VR interface LEDs
 - Select digital input resistor values
 - Finalise selection of wakeup pin
 - Verify that TC427COA can drive 100mA continuous
 - Protect LEDs with another diode OR
 - Select LEDs that have high reverse voltage capability
 - Double check that opto will work with unchanged SM
 - Tune the ADC input filters

And perhaps more.

### Pre-Layout Lock Down

As each sheet becomes a perfect representation of what we want to see in RavAGE
it will get locked. That is to say, no further changes to that sheet's source
.SchDoc file will be allowed without agreement between all key players.

Locked sheets will be listed here as they are finalised:

 - None yet, this is a placeholder
