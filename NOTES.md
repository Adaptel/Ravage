# Design Detail Notes

This file is to contain various details that aren't appropriate to show in the
schematic such as default specifications for passive components and deviations
from those defaults.

 - Unless otherwise noted, all resistors to be 1% metal film construction and 100mW power handling.
 - Pull up resistors on thermistor inputs and voltage measurement divider network resistors to be 0.1% metal film.
 - Capacitors 1.0uF and under to be X7R ceramic, and in very small values, C0G/NP0.
 - All polarised capacitors are tantalumn, 35V minimum when exposed to battery voltage, less for internal regulated voltages.
